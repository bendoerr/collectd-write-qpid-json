However it is based on the\r\n[rabbitmq-c][rmq1] client library. RabbitMQ does not support the AMQP 1.0/0-10\r\nversions of AMQP for whatever reason so I needed something else to talk to\r\nbrokers that only support AMQP 1.0/0-10 such as the Apache QPID C++ broker.\r\n\r\n## How do I use it?\r\n\r\nConfigure your collectd.conf something similar to what is below:\r\n```\r\n<LoadPlugin python>\r\n        Globals true\r\n</LoadPlugin>\r\n<Plugin python>\r\n        ModulePath \"/opt/collectd-write-qpid-json\"\r\n        Import write_qpid_json\r\n        <Module write_qpid_json>\r\n                TypesDB \"/opt/collectd/share/collectd/types.db\"\r\n                TypesDB \"/opt/collectd/etc/types.db\"\r\n                Exchange \"collectd\"\r\n        </Module>\r\n</Plugin>\r\n```\r\n\r\nLike many plugin's that use collectd's higher level language bindings, this\r\nplugin needs Collectd's [type.db][cd4] so that it can properly provide\r\nadditional metadata about each collected value. I couldn't find a decent way to\r\nask Collectd for this information so you will need to duplicate it here even\r\nthough it is higher up in the config tree.\r\n\r\n#### Support Options\r\n\r\nOption   | Default      | Description\r\n:------- |:------------ |:-----------\r\nTypesDB  | [\"/usr/share/collectd/types.db\"] | List of TypesDB paths.\r\nHost     | \"localhost\"  | Host of the AMQP endpoint.\r\nPort     | \"5672\"       | Port that the AMQP endpoint is listening on.\r\nUser     | \"guest\"      | \r\nPassword | \"guest\"      | \r\nExchange | \"amq.fanout\" | AMQP address to send messages to.\r\n\r\n## Should I use this?\r\n\r\nI don't know if you should use it? I'm using it. I'll be responsive\r\nif you have questions, fixes, bugs, if that helps. If you have any of\r\nthose you can interact with me via Github or shoot me an email\r\n(craftsman@bendoerr.me).\r\n\r\n<!-- TODO add details about why I wrote this, -->\r\n\r\n## License\r\n```\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2015 Ben Doerr\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
